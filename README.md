This Website is designed with movie buffs in mind who are always on the go and would like to maintain a list of movies that they would like to watch. And, perhaps would do a binge watch one day.

Itâ€™s a light weight application that allows user to browse and movies to a watchlist and later move them to a watched list.

## Description
